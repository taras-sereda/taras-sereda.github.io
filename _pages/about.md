I'm a Machine Learning Researcher, Engineer, and DIY Enthusiast. My career is built around Machine Learning research projects in vision and audio. At this moment, Iâ€™m providing consultancy services concerning speech and audio processing, particularly for building text-to-speech (TTS) systems. My interests lie in self-supervised methods and discrete representations of audio.
