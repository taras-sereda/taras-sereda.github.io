I'm Machine Learner/Startuper/Lecturer/Traveler/Piano player/Film Photographer/DIY Enthusiast. My carier is build around Machine Learning research projects in vision and audio. At this moment I'm working on exciting project: [VocalicsAI](https://www.vocalics.ai/). Voice content localization platform, which transfers speaker's authentic voice and delivery style to world languages.

- I like to walk a lot, it helps me to think clearer.
- I appreciate in person meetings and discussions. even though I think that I'm mostly an introvert.
- I like chebureki from Musafir.
