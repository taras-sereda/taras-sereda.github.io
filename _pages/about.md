I'm Machine Learner/Startuper/Lecturer/Traveler/Piano player/Film Photographer/DIY Enthusiast. My career is built around Machine Learning research projects in vision and audio. At this moment I’m working on an exciting project: [ProsodyLab](https://prosodylab.com). Voice content localization platform, which transfers the speaker’s authentic voice and delivery style to world languages.
